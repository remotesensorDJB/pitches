# SPATIAL DATA CONCEPTS AND VISUALIZATION
## GEOG 350 - FALL 2017

### Donald J. Biddle

### The Plan
* Talk about *Geographic Scale*
 * What is it? How do we represent it? Large scale vs small scale.
 * What are the effects/limitations of scale?
 * How do we make decisions about scale in our mapping efforts?
* Talk about *Scale of Measurement*
 * What are *levels* of data
 * What is data normalization?
---
### The Plan
* Talk about *Thematic Mapping*
 * Data Classification > Choropleth Mapping
 * Ways to classify data
 * The role of color/shading
* Other ways to represent data
 * Dot Density
 * Proportional Symbols
 * Cartograms
 * Vector Fields
---
### Geographic *(Map)* Scale
 >*The ratio of a distance on a map to the corresponding distance on the ground* 
---
### Representing Map Scale
* Representative Fraction
 * 1:24,000
* Textual Scale
 * *One inch equals 24,000 inches*
 * *1" = 2,000'*
* Graphical Scale
 * Scale Bars

### Large or Small Scale??
#### Easy way to remember:
>*Features appear **larger** in **large** scale maps, and **smaller** in **small** scale maps*
#### CAUTION!
>A large number does not equal a large scale map!

#### Examples of large vs. small scale maps
